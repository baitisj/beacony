Beacony
=======
Based on AX25 Apps 0.0.8-rc4.
I removed a lot of stuff and what's behind is this program.
It listens to the AX25 interface and poops out beacons.
And that's all it does!

There's a script here that will `write` the output of the
beacon to your terminal which is the author's intended
usage case:
    sudo beacony/beacony | python beaconwriter.py

To build:
autoreconf -fi
./configure
make

_Description: Make listen setuid root?
 The listen program needs to make calls as the root user.  One way of doing
 this is to make the program setuid root.  This is generally a bad idea as
 there are better ways, such as using the sudo program, to do this.
 However, you have the option of making it setuid root here if you like.
